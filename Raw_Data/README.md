## About These Files

All of the files in this directory contain the raw data obtained through
crowdsoucing. We have only provided results where at last 3 of the 5
annotators marked a candidate as an event.

event_groups.tsv
	Events as grouped by our event clustering approach, described in our CIKM 
	paper. The line number of the group is the number given to the event.

all_descriptions_categories.tsv		
	The combined listing of all the event detections and categories 
	provided by crowdsourced workers. This same information, split
	by method used to generate it, is provided in the corresponding
	folders.
